The proposed CIDR blocks cover a wide range of IP addresses, but they may include additional addresses that are not part of the specific IPs. This approach provides a broader coverage, which is easier to manage but less precise. 
It’s essential to confirm that the wider ranges do not inadvertently block IPs outside of the intended list.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the coverage for each range, which shows they encapsulate the specific IPs:

    104.131.128.0/19 – This block covers every IP address from 104.131.128.0 to 104.131.159.255. All IPs within the range 104.131.128.X and 104.131.144.X are included.
    107.170.192.0/18 – This block covers from 107.170.192.0 to 107.170.223.255. It includes all IPs within the range 107.170.192.X to 107.170.208.X.
    138.68.208.0/20 – Covers all IPs from 138.68.208.0 to 138.68.223.255, perfectly encapsulating the range 138.68.208.X.
    159.203.192.0/18 – Includes IPs from 159.203.192.0 to 159.203.223.255, covering all listed IPs starting with 159.203.192.X and 159.203.208.X.
    162.243.128.0/17 – Encompasses every IP from 162.243.128.0 to 162.243.255.255, ensuring all your 162.243.128.X to 162.243.145.X IPs are covered.
    192.241.192.0/18 – Covers IPs from 192.241.192.0 to 192.241.223.255, which includes all your listed IPs from 192.241.192.X through 192.241.236.X.
    198.199.100.0/18 – This block covers from 198.199.100.0 to 198.199.127.255, encompassing all IPs from 198.199.100.X to 198.199.117.X.
    45.55.0.0/19 – This range from 45.55.0.0 to 45.55.31.255 includes the IPs starting with 45.55.0.X.


    Verify Unintended Coverage: Check if there are any IPs within these blocks that should not be blocked.
    Adjust Precision as Needed: If finer control is necessary, consider using more specific CIDR blocks or combining CIDR blocking with explicit allow rules for exceptions.


for adding to pfsense aliases. We need to shorten the long list down to CIDR. Taking up way too much resources for a constant bad actor.

104.131.128.0/19 This block covers every IP address from 104.131.128.0 to 104.131.159.255. All IPs within the range 104.131.128.X and 104.131.144.X are included
107.170.192.0/18 This block covers from 107.170.192.0 to 107.170.223.255. It includes all IPs within the range 107.170.192.X to 107.170.208.X
138.68.208.0/20 Covers all IPs from 138.68.208.0 to 138.68.223.255, perfectly encapsulating the range 138.68.208.X.
159.203.192.0/18 Includes IPs from 159.203.192.0 to 159.203.223.255, covering all listed IPs starting with 159.203.192.X and 159.203.208.X
